# What can you use BandOpticon for?
I wrote BandOpticon so that I could get a live view of all bands simultaneously, but without all bands being plotted on the same map.
Very early on this led me towards making something based on a grid of tiles, each covering one band and/or mode. In my mind there are two
main uses:
1. The 'all bands at once' view, with an option for a detailed view showing connectivity of one or a few bands, and
2. A way of overlaying my tx/rx spots with those of other stations 'close to' me.
   
Below are some examples. I hope I've created something that allows you to get to what information you want easily.

### All Band Overview

### Connectivity Detail
This screenshot shows detail from a plot of 2m FT8 activity. You can brows the callsigns by hovering the mouse, and you can select calls to 
highlight from the list of 'home' calls on the left.

### Benchmarking My Rx performance
In the screenshot below, the stronger colours show my Rx spots against the background of everyone else's.
