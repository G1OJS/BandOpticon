<h1>Numbering scheme</h1> 
From [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:   
- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes   
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner   
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

<h1>To-do list & ideas</h1> 

To do:
  - also allow users to specify JO64bd:lj (Good for me to get south coast without France in JO00!)
  - switch to https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/

Code tidying:
  - delete lines 566 to 598 and use a set difference in lines 608-615 and 625-633 to get "only by me" rows. This info is already in the myCall rows, but the extra row helps to highlight it
  - rewrite with less 'data in variable names' (the entities spotted and received by, etc)'
  - define functions to make flow more aparrent in writeStats
  - look at updateDetails and updateControls - see if they can be rationalised
     or clarified a bit (purpose vs name). updateDetails is more of a handler for 
     click to change events than anything
  - check consistency of let, var, continuation + and \ and <br> plus variable names e.g.
     - IMMUTABLE = const
     - Capital_plurals = Set
     - camelCasePluralsArr = Array
