# BandOpticon
### Where is each band open to from *my* local area? How active are they? What modes are being used? What DX are others in my area receiving and being spotted by? What squares are they reaching and spotting? What squares and callsigns am I reaching and spotting that other stations aren't? All on one screen??

## BONUS - works great on phones and tablets too! [click here]({{ site.baseurl }}/BandOpticon)

This software uses data from Pskreporter to present a view of band activity on all active bands simultaneously. This is useful for seeing where the activity is and for spotting band openings. You can also simultaneously view detail for a single band, showing which callsigns are transmitting and which are receiving, and which DX squares or callsigns are being reached and spotted by them.

Active stations and spots are drawn from your specified group of Maidenhead squares, which provides fine control over what you want to specify as "Home". You can specify a grouping of squares of any level (for example, IO, JO01, JO03kk can be added as one group to represent your Home location). Spots are counted if at least one 'end' is in Home, and ignored if both ends are outside Home.

What you can see using this software includes:
- which active stations are transmitting or just receiving. In other words, are there stations actively working the bands, or have they just left their equipment running & gone to work - or are they even a WEBSDR station?
- whether the active stations are getting spotted by more DX calls than they are spotting themselves, or vice versa. In other words, how is receive performance stacking up against transmit performance for the active stations?
- Easily compare this with your own transmit and receive spots. How does this compare to your own station's performance? If you aren't receiving or tranmitting as well as you'd like, is this a problem with your setup or is it just how the band is currently?
- which DX callsigns are spotting, and being spotted by, the active callsigns in your specified squares. i.e. where is each band open to from your specified 'home region'.
- what squares / callsigns you're reaching/spotting, and which ONLY you are reaching/spotting
- what modes are being used on each band, and across all bands
- which bands are open and which have no activity
