# BandOpticon
### Where is each band open to from *my* local area? How active are they? What DX are others in my area receiving and being spotted by? What squares are they reaching and spotting? All on one screen??

## BONUS - works great on phones and tablets too! [click here]({{ site.baseurl }}/BandOpticon)

This software uses data from Pskreporter to present a view of band activity on all (main) bands simultaneously. This is useful for seeing where the activity is and for spotting band openings. You can also simultaneously view detail for a single band, showing which callsigns are transmitting and which are receiving, and which DX squares are being reached and spotted by them.

Active stations and spots are drawn from your specified group of Maidenhead squares, which provides more control over the data selection than is available on the Pskreporter map views. Instead of "Country of callsign" you have access to a grouping of squares of any level (for example, IO, JO01, JO03kk can be added as one group).

What you can see using this software includes:
- See which active stations are transmitting or just receiving. In other words, are there stations actively working the bands, or have they just left their 
equipment running & gone to work - or are they even a WEBSDR station?
- Get a view of whether the active stations are getting spotted by more DX calls than they are spotting themselves, or vice versa. In other words, how is receive performance stacking up against transmit performance for the active stations?
- Easily compare this with your own transmit and receive spots. How does this compare to your own station's performance? If you aren't receiving or tranmitting as well as you'd like, is this a problem with your setup or is it just how the band is currently?
- See which DX callsigns are spotting, and being spotted by, the active callsigns in your specified squares. i.e. where is each band open to from your specified 'home region'.

The software runs in Javascript on your machine and requires no downloads. Just click [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/BandOpticon) to watch the statistics evolve.
