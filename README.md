### A live, visual, geographic view showing all bands and modes at once across the whole world, a filtered view, or a single connection:

### What is the activity like on each band to and from *my* local area? What modes are being used? What is the coverage like on those bands? Is it reciprocal? Where am I hearing and/or being heard by compared to others in my area?
This software uses data from Pskreporter to present a view of band activity on all active bands simultaneously, and you can filter and zoom in as much or as little as you need.

The software runs in Javascript on your machine and requires no downloads. Just click [here](https://g1ojs.github.io/BandOpticon/BandOpticon) to watch the views evolve.

### A mention in The Communicator
Thanks to Editor John Schouten VE7TI [communicator@VE7SAR.net](communicator@VE7SAR.net) for mentioning an early version of BandOpticon in the March/April 2025 issue of [The Communicator - the magazine for Canada's Surrey Amateur Radio Society (SARC)](https://www.ve7sar.net/communicator). I've bookmarked this magazine & encourage you to check it out; free, readable online, packed with really good & succinct articles!
