# Numbering scheme
From [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/)

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

  MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
  MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
  PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
  
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
