Hi, 

This idea started because I wanted an easy way to compare the spots I'm getting and giving, with those of other callsigns in my area.

Over the last week or so this has developed into a Javascript web page on my GitHub that live-updates with lots of information about the current state of the bands, including who's spotting whom, which squares are being reached/heard, which bands are active, what modes are being used etc, all drawn from live Pskreporter data.

I'd like others to find this useful, so here's the link:

The readme page: https://g1ojs.github.io/BandOpticon/
